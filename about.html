      <p class="about">Hello, My name is Miles Aylward. I am an ex-chef turned coder/web developer. At 23 years old I decided I needed to get out of the restaurant industry before I found myself 40 years old and burned out. After much research I found that tech was the undeniable way to go so I took to the internet to learn the basics of Web Development. I had designed my first website within a week, and I was hooked. I wanted to spend every minute learning new tricks for coding, practicing every language I could get my hands on, and of course figure out why my darn javascript kept crashing. I am a self taught Coder with a passion for learning, a logical mind geared toward problem solving, and a penchant for being the very best I can at everything I do.</p>
      <p class="about" id="about-sub">Currently designing websites for free to build my portfolio, if your interested follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCodingIrish" id="follow-me">@TheCodingIrish</a></p>
